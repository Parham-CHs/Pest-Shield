                            SKEDADDLE’S STORY
                        </h2>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">
                            Skedaddle’s story began in 1989 when Founder and President Bill Dowd got into the wildlife control business with the goal of resolving client’s wildlife problems using humane methods. At that time trapping and relocating wild animals was the most common approach used by exterminators and trappers. Bill soon realized that wildlife that are trapped and relocated have slim chances of survival in their new environments and that most service providers were offering homeowners very little in the way of preventing future incidents. It was pretty clear that trapping wasn’t going to get rid of all the wild animals in the city and homeowners needed better solutions when they got too close to comfort.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Skedaddle has grown from humble beginnings, Bill’s first office was his childhood bedroom in Hamilton, Ontario. His mother was his first employee, serving as receptionist. Armed with a pager and a service van, Bill placed an ad in the phonebook and calls began to roll in from across Southern Ontario. Each day presented new and unique challenges to overcome, but each grateful client convinced Bill he was on to something.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            “Since the day I got started, my mission has remained unchanged: to provide humane wildlife removal services that homeowners can trust. That trust, forged in the earliest days of our company, remains the cornerstone of everything we do. As we’ve grown, we’ve never lost sight of the importance of being there for our clients when they need us most.” said Bill Dowd, Skedaddle President & CEO.

                            Along the way, techniques, equipment and systems were developed to find humane solutions to all sorts of wildlife conflicts. A typical day might start with removing a raccoon family from an attic, then racing to capture a bat flying around a living room and capping it all off going face to face with a skunk burrowed below a front porch.

                            In just a few short years Skedaddle was ready to grow, launching new locations in Ottawa and later Montreal.

Today Skedaddle provides service in over 40 locations across Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, British Columbia as well as Wisconsin, Maryland and Minnesota in the United States. Skedaddle remains excited to continue growing and helping homeowners across North America.
