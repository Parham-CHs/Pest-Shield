                    When wildlife makes its way into your home it can create unwanted stress for you and your family. When this unfortunate circumstance arises, most homeowners are left with many tough questions. How did they get into my house? How do I keep them out? What kind of damage have they done?
            
                    No need to worry, Skedaddle Humane Wildlife Control has you covered. Since 1989, we’ve been employing industry-leading removal and exclusion techniques. Our friendly and knowledgeable staff take the time to understand your unique situation and implement a customized solution that guarantees superior results.
                    
                    We don’t just drop off a trap and cross our fingers and we never use harmful poisons or chemicals. When it comes to controlling critters our technicians roll up their sleeves to make sure the job is done right. That means climbing roofs, crawling in attics and using hands-on techniques that keep animals out for good.
                    
                    Our proven three-step process ensures that your home and family are protected as part of the Skedaddle Humane Wildlife Control service experience.
